# Stock Market Analysis Using Machine Learning

# Overview
This project, titled "Stock Market Analysis using ML", is undertaken for Trade&Ahead, a financial consultancy firm. The objective is to analyze stock market data, group stocks based on financial indicators, and provide actionable insights into the characteristics of each group.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, the analysis aids in personalizing investment strategies for the firmâ€™s customers.

# Problem Statement
Trade&Ahead has provided data comprising stock prices and various financial indicators of companies listed under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The task involves:
Analyzing the provided stock market data.
Clustering/grouping the stocks based on attributes such as ROE, P/E ratio, earnings per share, etc.
Deriving insights to explain the characteristics of each group.

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes:

Stock Prices: Historical prices of stocks over time.
Financial Indicators:
Return on Equity (ROE)
Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
Additional indicators that are critical to evaluating stock performance.

# Project Workflow
The project is carried out in the following steps:

Step 1: Data Understanding and Preprocessing
Load the provided dataset and inspect its structure.
Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Normalize/scale the data for machine learning models.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze trends and correlations between financial indicators.
Visualize the distribution of key metrics like ROE, EPS, and P/E ratios.
Highlight any significant patterns or anomalies in the dataset.
Step 3: Stock Clustering
Use unsupervised learning techniques (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group stocks based on financial indicators.
Evaluate the optimal number of clusters using methods like Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.
Assign each stock to a cluster and analyze the characteristics of each group.
Step 4: Insights and Reporting
Identify common patterns in each cluster (e.g., high-growth, stable, undervalued stocks).
Provide actionable insights to assist Trade&Ahead in recommending personalized investment strategies.
Step 5: Create interactive visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
